                <p>The Community Service Project (CSP) is an initiative by Vemu Institute of Technology aimed at making a positive impact on the local community. It involves our students actively engaging in various activities that address social, environmental, and educational needs.</p>
                <p>Through the CSP, we strive to create a sense of social responsibility and encourage our students to contribute their skills and knowledge for the betterment of society. Our projects range from organizing awareness campaigns, volunteering at local charities, participating in environmental conservation efforts, and providing educational support to underprivileged children.</p>
