        <h2 class="content-title">About Water Pollution</h2>
        <p class="content-text">Water pollution refers to the contamination of water bodies such as rivers, lakes, oceans, and groundwater, making the water unfit for its intended use and harmful to the environment and living organisms.</p>
        <p class="content-text">Water pollution can occur due to various sources, including industrial activities, agricultural practices, improper waste disposal, sewage discharge, oil spills, and chemical runoff. These pollutants can have detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems, human health, and biodiversity.</p>
    
        <div class="types-container">
            <h2 class="types-title">Types of Water Pollution</h2>

                    <h3 class="type-heading">Industrial Pollution</h3>
                    <p class="type-description">Industrial activities release various pollutants into water bodies, including toxic chemicals, heavy metals, and organic compounds. These pollutants can cause significant harm to aquatic life and ecosystems.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="type-item">

                    <h3 class="type-heading">Agricultural Pollution</h3>
                    <p class="type-description">Agricultural practices such as excessive use of fertilizers, pesticides, and animal waste can lead to water pollution. These pollutants can enter water bodies through runoff and negatively impact water quality and aquatic organisms.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="type-item">
                    <img class="type-image" src="../Img/WaterPolution/sewage-pollution.jpeg" alt="Sewage Pollution">
                    <h3 class="type-heading">Sewage Pollution</h3>
                    <p class="type-description">Improperly treated or untreated sewage discharge can introduce harmful bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens into water bodies. This type of pollution poses serious health risks to humans and aquatic life.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="type-item">
                    <img class="type-image" src="../Img/WaterPolution/OilSpillages.webp" alt="Oil Spills">
                    <h3 class="type-heading">Oil Spills</h3>
                    <p class="type-description">Oil spills from accidents involving ships, pipelines, or offshore drilling can have catastrophic effects on marine ecosystems. Oil spreads rapidly across the water surface, coating plants, animals, and shorelines, leading to long-term ecological damage.</p>
                </li>

                    <h3 class="type-heading">Chemical Water Pollution</h3>
                    <p class="type-description">Chemical pollutants such as pesticides, herbicides, and industrial chemicals can contaminate water bodies. These chemicals can have toxic effects on aquatic organisms and pose risks to human health when consumed.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="type-item">

                    <h3 class="type-heading">Suspended Matter</h3>
                    <p class="type-description">Suspended matter refers to solid particles, such as sediment, silt, and organic matter, that remain suspended in water. Excessive amounts of suspended matter can reduce water clarity, block sunlight, and disrupt aquatic ecosystems.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="type-item">

                    <h3 class="type-heading">Oxygen-Depletion Pollution</h3>
                    <p class="type-description">Oxygen-depletion pollution occurs when organic matter, such as sewage or excessive nutrients, enters water bodies. The decomposition of organic matter by bacteria consumes oxygen, leading to reduced oxygen levels in the water, which can harm fish and other aquatic organisms.</p>
