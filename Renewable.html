        <h2 class="content-title">About Renewable Energy</h2>
        <p class="content-text">Renewable energy refers to energy that is collected from renewable resources, which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. These energy sources are considered sustainable and have a minimal impact on the environment compared to non-renewable sources like fossil fuels.</p>
        <p class="content-text">Renewable energy plays a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change. It provides an alternative to fossil fuel-based energy generation, helping to mitigate air pollution, reduce dependence on finite resources, and promote a more sustainable future.</p>
        <p class="content-text">Various technologies are used to harness renewable energy, including:</p>

                <h3 class="content-title">Wind Energy</h3>
                <p class="content-text">Wind energy harnesses the kinetic energy of moving air by using large wind turbines located on land (onshore) or in sea- or freshwater (offshore). Wind energy has been used for millennia, but onshore and offshore wind energy technologies have evolved over the last few years to maximize the electricity produced - with taller turbines and larger rotor diameters.</p>
